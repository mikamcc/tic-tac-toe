## Screenshot of Tic Tac Toe

## Description of Main Features
  Click in any box to start the game against the AI. The score is collected automatically. You can reset the game and clear the score to     hide your shame.:see_no_evil:
## List of Any Known Bugs
  The AI is fast…perhaps too fast and needs a pause or delay after an event (left click from human player). And the AI is also dumb…         perhaps too dumb. But that’s great news for you—our star player!

## Tech Used 
  HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. 
  
## Reflection
  It was nice to have the opportunity to apply what was taught in the first two weeks of the WDI course.
